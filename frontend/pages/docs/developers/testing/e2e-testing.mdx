# End to End Testing

In order to test that Bailo is working correctly we make use of the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) testing library.
Much like Jest, Cypress is a vastly used and effective library for testing end to end workflows.

Whilst components might pass individual unit tests there might be instances where they do not work as expected when used
in conjunction with each other.

## File structure

All of our end to end tests are located within the `cypress` directory found at the root of the project. Inside there is
a `e2e` directory that includes all of the workflows. Each workflow must have be suffixed with 'cy.ts'.

A workflow is a collection of tests that test not just one aspect of the application, but a set of related actions. For
example, uploading a model, reviewing said model and requesting a deployment of a model would be three separate actions,
but all tied in one workflow. Much like unit tests, individual workflow tests must be able to be run independently of
each other, despite all being in the same workflow.

The `fixtures` directory contains any common mocked data that might be required for testing.

## Running the tests

In order to check that your tests work locally, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run cy:open
```

## Examples

### Example of a workflow

Throughout the source of Bailo you might see data-test properties in various components. These are used for Cypress to
easily find elements in the DOM so that the tests can check that the page is correctly rendered, and also for actions to
be taken (such as button clicks).

#### MyComponent.tsx

```typescript
...
<Button data-test='myButton'>Click me!</Button>
...
```

#### my-workflow.cy.ts

```typescript
describe('My workflow', () => {
  it('test we can click the button', function () {
    cy.get('[data-test=myButton]').click()
  })
})
```

### Example of interacting with fixtures

Fixtures are used for storing test data; not only does it mean that all test data is stored in one centralised place, it
also allows Cypress to fetch it using the `cy.fixture()` function.

```typescript
cy.fixture('my_data.json').then((data) => {
  cy.get(`[role=option]:contains(${data.property})`).click()
})
```

### `before()` & `beforeEach()`

Sometimes there is code that should be ran at the start of the workflow, or before each test. `before()` is called at
the start of the workflow before all tests, whereas `beforeEach()` is called before each individual test.

```typescript
describe('My workflow', () => {
  before(() => {
    cy.log('This is run once')
  })

  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.log('This will be run twice')
  })

  it('test 1', function () {
    // Test stuff here
  })

  it('test 2', function () {
    // Test stuff here
  })
})
```

### Sharing Context

An important part of tests is being able to share values between them. Below is an example of setting a value inside our
beforeEach call and then accessing it inside a test.

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.get('button').invoke('text').as('text')
})

it('has access to text', function () {
  this.text // is now available
})
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
