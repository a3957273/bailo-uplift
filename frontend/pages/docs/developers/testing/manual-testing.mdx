# Manual Testing

Automated testing does not always pick up newly introduced bugs. As a developer, it is your responsibility to make sure
that any work has been both thoroughly automated and manually tested so that we can reduce the number of issues in the
main branch of the source code. Likewise, if you are reviewing a pull request and there are substantial changes to core
functionality, it is vital that you manually test the code locally as well and not just rely on automated testing.

## Process

When you have either developed or reviewed code that has made significant changes to core functionality, you will need
to test that the following actions all still function correctly:

- Upload a model
  - As code and binary
  - As just a model card
  - As a Docker container
- Can favourite the model and view it in the marketplace
- Edit the version
- Upload a new version
- Review the version
- Can request a deployment
- Review that deployment
- If the version is not just a model card, pull down the container and check all files are there, or if you have used an
  actual model, make sure it runs correctly

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
