# Authentication

Bailo is intended to be run in multiple different environments, each of which will have their own standard
authentication and authorisation methods. To enable this, Bailo exposes a class of methods that can be overriden for
specific uses.

This is done by editing server/external/Authorisation.ts to extend AuthorisationBase and re-implementing the functions
with your desired authorisation method. The file in `server/utils/AuthorisationBase.ts` contains an existing example of
this, which uses headers to pass user id and email.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
