# Developer Setup

Bailo is designed to be developed within a Docker-Compose network that consists of all Bailo dependencies as well as a
live-updating application pod. The developer setup requires the following to run:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/)

We currently require the use of the standalone docker-compose executable, instead of the plugin. This is due to buildkit
support not being complete in the plugin yet.

Once the dependencies are installed, run the application with the following steps:

```bash
# Clone the Bailo repository locally
git clone https://github.com/gchq/Bailo.git && cd Bailo

# Install dependencies.  This is optional, but makes future Docker builds faster.
npm install

# Create some development certificates, required for the registry and application.
npm run certs

# Start up the docker-compose stack, altering the UID to allow live reloading.
sed "s/user_id=REPLACE_WITH_UID/user_id=$UID/" docker-compose-dev.yml > docker-compose-dev-personal.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev-personal.yml up --force-recreate --build -d
```

On first run, it may take a while (perhaps 30 seconds) to start up. It needs to build several hundred TypeScript
modules. Future starts only require a few seconds, as the modules are cached. There's also `npm run dev2` for an
alternative type checker that is more rigorous. You should access the site via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
which provides authentication as a test user.

The development environment starts the following services:

| Service      | Host  | Notes                  |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------------- |
| NodeJS App   | 3000  | Internal app port      |
| Nginx        | 8080  | Access the UI via this |
| Mongo        | 27017 | No credentials         |
| Registry     | 5000  | HTTPS only, no UI      |
| Minio UI     | 9001  | minioadmin:minioadmin  |
| Minio        | 9000  | minioadmin:minioadmin  |
| Maildev Web  | 1080  | View emails sent       |
| Maildev SMTP | 1023  | Fake mail server       |

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
