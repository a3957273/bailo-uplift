# Building the Bailo Image

Bailo does not provide pre-built images. Building one yourself is easy! To build an image for deployment, run the
following command:

```bash
$ docker build -t "bailo:\<version\>" -f Dockerfile.prod .
```

`docker` can be swapped out for any other OCI compliant container build platform. We routinely test with both `podman`
and `OpenShift Builder`. This image should be pushed to a registry that is accessible from your deployment target.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
