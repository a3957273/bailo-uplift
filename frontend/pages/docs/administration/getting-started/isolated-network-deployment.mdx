# Isolated Network Deployment

## Helm

We rely on the following Bitnami charts:

- MinIO https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
- MongoDB https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

## Docker

We rely on the following images:

- node
- registry
- seldon/seldon-core-s2i-python37
- maildev/maildev
- nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged

## NPM

We rely on many NPM packages. The list is available within `package-lock.json`. Most are standard packages with the
exception of:

- `selenium-webdriver`, which powers our integration tests and downloads `firefox` from the internet.
- `sharp`, which is an optimised image transformer and requires some compilation tools.

Both are optional and can be removed with:

```bash
npm remove selenium-webdriver sharp
```

Detailed instructions for building `sharp` on various platform is available on the
[installation page](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install).
