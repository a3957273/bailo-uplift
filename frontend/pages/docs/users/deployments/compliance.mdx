# Deployment Compliance

A deployment is unavailable until it has passed all compliance checks. These are outlined under the 'compliance' tab.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoDeploymentCompliance} />
</Box>

The colour of each step represents its current state:

- White: Step cannot be completed at this time
- Yellow: Step in progress
- Red: Step failed
- Green: Step succeeded

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Failed

If Bailo fails to deploy an image, this step will fail. Bailo automatically retries deployments three times. The logs
from Bailo deploying can be found under the 'build logs' tag. Deployments should not fail to build, any failure here
will need to be fixed by a system administrator.

#### Checks Failed

If an approver rejects your model, the 'check' field will be red. You will need to contact the approver and discuss how
to resolve the issue. An approver can go to the 'archived' section of the approvals at any time to update the state of
the approval.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
