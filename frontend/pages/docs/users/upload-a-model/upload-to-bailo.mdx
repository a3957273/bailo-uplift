# Uploading to Bailo

Now that you have made a model and prepared `code.zip` and `binary.zip` files, it is time to post it to Bailo. This
guide assumes you will use the UI to fill out the required model card and upload the files, but we also have an API as
well as clients in several languages to make the process more automatic.

First, visit the [/upload](/upload) page. Here you will see a form taking you through the steps required to upload your
model. There is also:

- A 'schema' dropdown, which lets you select different model schemas to follow.
- An 'uploading existing' tab, which lets you upload premade JSON.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoUpload} />
</Box>

Each tab has a state, either 'in progress' or 'done'. Once all tabs are done, you can head to the 'submission' tab and
upload your model.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoUploadSubmission} />
</Box>

The submission tab enables you to export your data in both a human readable (HTML) format and a machine readable (JSON)
format. After confirming your data is correct, you should press 'Submit' to upload your model to Bailo.

After submitting your model, a progress bar will appear as the files and data are uploaded to Bailo. Upon completion,
you will be redirected to your model:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoModelPage} />
</Box>

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
