# Requirements

You should consider uploading a model once you have trained and tested it in your own environment and you feel that it
is **production ready**. Bailo is not intended to hold models until they have reached this point and so any development
must be carried out in an external environment. As a model developer you must make yourself aware of and meet the
requirements that are placed on you under the AI Policy and ensure that you have appropriate data owner approval to use
the training data that you have identified.

To submit a model you will need to provide the following three artifacts:

- A model card containing details of the provenance, training, limitations and bias, along with any lifecycle deadlines
- The trained model binary, representing the trained model itself
- Supporting code that exposes defined endpoints on the model (notably a `predict` or `predict_raw` endpoint)

The model card can either be designed using the [upload form](/upload) or as a JSON blob that follows the
[upload schema](/api/v1/schema/default?use=UPLOAD).

More information on the supporting code and binary formats are provided later in this documentation.
