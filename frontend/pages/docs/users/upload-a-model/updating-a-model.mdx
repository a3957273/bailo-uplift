## Editing a Model

To edit a model, first make sure it has not been approved by both the manager and technical reviewer; then select edit
on the actions tab. This will bring up a form identical to the model upload form, except without the file upload and
schema selection. Make any changes, then submit on the Submission tab.

## Uploading a New Version

To upload a new version, select Upload new version on the actions tab. This will bring up a form identical to the model
upload form, except without schema selection. Make any changes, then submit on the Submission tab.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
